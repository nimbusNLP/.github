## Nimbus: An open-source framework that simplifies deployment of lightweight NLP models.

**Nimbus is an open-source framework designed to simplify the deployment of lightweight, task-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to the cloud.**

Deploying even simple NLP models often involves complex infrastructure setup, dependency management, and operational overhead, creating a barrier for individuals and small teams. Nimbus automates these challenging parts using a developer-friendly CLI and AWS serverless technology (Lambda, API Gateway, CDK), making it easier and more cost-effective to turn your trained models into production-ready API endpoints.
